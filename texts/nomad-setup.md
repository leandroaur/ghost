## Step 2: Installing Consul

1. Install Consul with `apt` or download the binary directly.
2. Configure the Consul agent:
   - Create a `consul.hcl` file to configure the datacenter and communication with other agents.

## Step 3: Configuring Fabio as a Load Balancer

1. Download Fabio from the official repository.
2. Add basic configurations in the `fabio.properties` file:
   - `registry.consul.addr=localhost:8500`
   - `registry.consul.tagprefix=urlprefix-`
3. Start Fabio and verify that it correctly registers services in Consul.

## Conclusion

After following these steps, you will have a functional environment with Nomad, Consul, and Fabio. Common issues, such as port conflicts and unregistered services, can be resolved by adjusting configurations in the `*.hcl` files.
